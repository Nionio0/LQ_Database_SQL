183. Customers Who Never Order

https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/

## Problem Description

```
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

```

## Code

``` sql

Select c.name Customers

From Customers c

Where c.Id not in 
    (Select CustomerId from Orders);
    
```

``` sql

Select Name as Customers

From customers left join orders on customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId

Where Orders.CustomerId is null;
    
```

## Key point
解法一：
Not in (再select一遍)

解法二：
left join, is null
