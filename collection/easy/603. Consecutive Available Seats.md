## Problem

603. Consecutive Available Seats

https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-available-seats/

## Problem Description

```

Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |

Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

```

## Code

``` sql

Select distinct a.seat_id 
From cinema a join cinema b on Abs(a.seat_id-b.seat_id) = 1 
and a.free = 1 and b.free = 1
Order by seat_id;

```

## Key point

self join

ABS取绝对值
