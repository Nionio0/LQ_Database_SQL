## Problem

196. Delete Duplicate Emails

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/

## Problem Description

```
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, 
keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.

For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.

```

## Code

``` sql
Delete From Person

Where Id not in (Select * from

(Select Min(Id) From Person Group by Email) as p )

```

``` sql

DELETE p1 FROM Person p1,
    Person p2
WHERE
    p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id

```


## Key point

as p: Every derived table must have its own alias
