## Problem
176. Second Highest Salary

https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/

## Problem Description

```
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

```

## Code

``` sql
Select Salary as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
Where Salary < (Select Max(Salary) from Employee) limit 1;

```

``` sql

Select Salary as SecondHighestSalary
From Employee
Order by Salary desc limit 1 offset 1;

```

## Key point
解法1：
bubble sort
max两遍

解法2：
Limit, offset

Select * from table limit 2, 1; *跳过两条，读1条数据，即第三条数据*

Select * from table limit 2 offset 1; *读2条数据，跳过1条，即第二、三条数据*

Select 8 from table limit 3; *返回前三行数据*
